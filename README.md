# NextGen README

NextGen is one of the few code generators enabling developers to 

- define their own Domain Specific Model, 
- define templatefiles containing code and references to the Model

After this, they can use NextGen to 

- fill the Model
- generate code

This extension allows the editing of the template files used to generate the code.

## Features

The single feature currently supported is syntax highlighting of the specific NextGen template language elements.

## Requirements

It will help if you install the NextGen application, to be able to use templates.

## Extension Settings

No settings.

## Known Issues

The function declaration allow for a comment at the end of the line. NextGen doesn't.
